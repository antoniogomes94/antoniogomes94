### Hi there! 😁

My name is Antonio Gomes from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as .NET Developer since 2017 and currently I'm .NET Developer at [G&P Projetos e Sistemas](http://www.gpnet.com.br/) work in projects on [Secretaria da Educação do Estado de São Paulo](https://www.educacao.sp.gov.br/). Despite working with a focus on .NET, I have ventured into new technologies like Python, React, React Native. In my final [postgraduate course](https://bra.ifsp.edu.br/cursos-artigos/334) I used Python to generate criminal maps of my city and published the [article](http://ibsp.org.br/ibsp/revista/index.php/RIBSP/article/view/69) in the [Revista do Instituto Brasileiro de Segurança Pública (RIBSP)](http://ibsp.org.br/ibsp/revista/index.php/RIBSP/index). And having participated in several events on React and React Native, with the knowledge learned I developed the [Covidfy](https://antoniogomes94.github.io/covidfy/) website, a portal that informs data about the Covid-19 pandemic.

In my free time I like to play videogame (🎮), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and drink beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
